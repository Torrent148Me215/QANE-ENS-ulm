# QANE-ENS-ulm
This is my master course "Quantitative Analysis In Neurosciences" in ENS - ulm, Paris from October 2017 to January 2018.

The goal of this course is to bridge key concepts in integrative neurophysiology (such as cortical plasticity, attentional processes, decision-making...) and the state-of-the art in terms of analysis and modeling techniques in neurosciences (receptive fields, stimulus decoding, stimulus classification...). Quantitative analysis are now a major component of integrative neurosciences as they allow testing and formulating predictions based on the large experimental datasets that are nowadays available.
